        <p>
            Step 1: Prepare the Dough
            Mix Ingredients: In a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour (if using), a pinch of salt, and 2 tablespoons of oil or ghee.
            Knead the Dough: Gradually add water and knead to form a soft and smooth dough. The dough should be pliable but not sticky.
            Rest the Dough: Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.
            Step 2: Prepare the Filling (Puran)
            Cook the Chana Dal: Rinse the chana dal thoroughly and pressure cook it with enough water for 3-4 whistles, or until it becomes soft. Drain any excess water.
            Mash the Dal: Mash the cooked dal well, or blend it in a mixer to get a smooth consistency.
            Cook the Filling: In a heavy-bottomed pan, add the mashed dal and grated jaggery. Cook on medium heat, stirring continuously until the mixture thickens and leaves the sides of the pan. This may take around 10-15 minutes.
            Add Spices: Add cardamom powder and nutmeg powder (if using) and mix well.
            Cool the Filling: Allow the filling to cool to room temperature.
            Step 3: Assemble and Cook Puran Poli
            Divide the Dough and Filling: Divide the dough and the filling into equal portions. Each portion of the filling should be slightly larger than the dough portions.
            Roll the Dough: Take a dough portion and flatten it with your fingers or a rolling pin into a small disc.
            Add the Filling: Place a portion of the filling in the center of the dough disc. Bring the edges of the dough together to encase the filling completely and pinch to seal.
            Roll the Poli: Gently flatten the filled dough ball and roll it out into a round disc (like a paratha), about 6-8 inches in diameter. Use dry flour to prevent sticking.
            Cook the Puran Poli: Heat a tawa or griddle over medium heat. Place the rolled Puran Poli on the tawa. Cook until you see bubbles forming on the surface, then flip.
            Add Ghee: Apply a little ghee on the top side and cook until golden brown spots appear. Flip again and apply ghee on the other side. Cook until both sides are well-cooked and golden brown.
            Repeat: Repeat the process with the remaining dough and filling portions.
            Step 4: Serve
            Serve Warm: Puran Poli is best enjoyed warm, with a dollop of ghee on top.
            Accompaniments: It can be served with a side of warm milk, ghee, or even amti (a tangy-spicy dal).
