        <h2> Instruction</h2>
        <p>
            Step 1: Prepare the Outer Covering Dough
            Boil Water: In a saucepan, bring 1 1/2 cups of water to a boil.
            Add Salt and Rice Flour: Add a pinch of salt to the boiling water. Reduce the heat to low and gradually add the rice flour while stirring continuously to prevent lumps from forming.Cook the Dough: Stir the mixture until it forms a smooth dough and starts to leave the sides of the pan. Turn off the heat and transfer the dough to a plate. Let it cool slightly.
            Step 2: Prepare the Filling
            Prepare the Coconut-Jaggery Mixture: Heat 1 teaspoon of ghee in a pan. Add the grated coconut and grated jaggery to the pan. Cook on medium heat, stirring continuously, until the jaggery melts and blends with the coconut. This will take about 5-7 minutes.
            Add Flavorings: Add cardamom powder and nutmeg powder (if using) to the coconut-jaggery mixture. Mix well. You can also add chopped nuts and raisins for extra flavor and texture. Remove from heat and let the mixture cool down.
            Step 3: Shape and Fill the Modaks
            Prepare Modak Mould: Grease a modak mould with ghee or oil to prevent sticking.
            Shape the Dough: Take a small portion of the dough and flatten it into a disc with your fingers. Alternatively, you can roll out the dough into small circles.
            Add Filling: Place a spoonful of the coconut-jaggery mixture in the center of the dough disc.
            Seal the Edges: Carefully gather the edges of the dough disc and pinch them together to seal, forming a cone-shaped dumpling.
            Repeat: Repeat the process with the remaining dough and filling.
            Step 4: Steam the Modaks
            Steam: Place the filled modaks in a steamer or a large pot with a steamer basket. Steam them for about 10-12 minutes on medium heat until they are cooked and firm.
            Cool: Once cooked, remove the modaks from the steamer and let them cool slightly before serving.
            Step 5: Serve
            Serve Warm: Modaks are traditionally served warm or at room temperature.
            Offer to Lord Ganesha: Offer the freshly made modaks to Lord Ganesha as part of the Ganesh Chaturthi festivities or enjoy them as a sweet treat with your family and friends.
